mongo-connector -m localhost:27017 -t http://localhost:8983/solr/stuffy -d solr_doc_manager

Better

mongo-connector --unique-key=id –n <db>.<collection> -m localhost:27017 -t http://localhost:8983/solr/wlslog -d solr_doc_manager
-n (namespace) to store collection <collection> from databse <db>
--unique-key=UNIQUE_KEY
    The name of the MongoDB field that will serve as the
    unique key for the target system (for me solr)


mongo-connector --unique-key=id –n nhsdb.nhsCollection -m localhost:27017 -t http://localhost:8983/solr/nhsCollection -d solr_doc_manager

Resyncing the connector
########################

1) After deleting documents in mongo it appear even though the connected sees it and seems to issue a delete,
SOLR is not updated.

2) Some disparities appears between replicas

See:
https://github.com/yougov/mongo-connector/wiki/Resyncing%20the%20Connector

    drop db:
    db.getSisterDB("nhsdb").dropDatabase()
    use nhsdb

    delete solr collection:
    curl http://localhost:8983/solr/nhsCollection/update?commit=true -H "Content-Type: text/xml" --data-binary '<delete><query>*:*</query></delete>'

    delete oplog.timestamp located in the wd where mongo-connector was started last
